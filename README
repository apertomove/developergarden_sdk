=== Installation
 sudo gem install developergarden_sdk

Dependent gems will be installed automatically.

=== Basic usage
You can use the gem from pure Ruby applications and of course from Ruby on Rails apps as well.

==== To use the gem from your Ruby app

 require 'rubygems'
 gem 'developergarden_sdk'
 require 'token_Service/token_service'
 require 'sms_service/sms_service'
 require 'voice_call_service/voice_call_service'
 require 'quota_service/quota_service'
 require 'service_environment'

==== Ruby Example to send a sms
 #!/usr/bin/env ruby -d

 require 'rubygems'
 gem 'developergarden_sdk'
 require 'token_Service/token_service'
 require 'sms_service/sms_service'
 require 'service_environment'

 sms = SmsService::SmsService.new("<USER>@t-online.de", "<PASSWORD>")
 sms_response = sms.send_sms("+49177 0000001", "Your message text.", "RubySDK", ServiceEnvironment.PRODUCTION, "")


=== Ruby Example to perform an ip location

 require 'rubygems'
 gem 'developergarden_sdk'
 require 'token_Service/token_service'
 require 'ip_location_service/ip_location_service'

 ip = IpLocationService::IpAddress.new("93.222.255.58")
 response = @ip_location_service.locate_ip(ip, ServiceEnvironment.PRODUCTION)

 puts response.ip_address_locations.first.address
 puts response.ip_address_locations.first.is_in_region.country_code
 puts response.ip_address_locations.first.is_in_region.region_name

 # If you except a single ip location (if you have passed a single ip to look up)
 # then you can use the following way to access the location
 puts response.ip_address_location.address
 puts response.ip_address_location.is_in_region.country_code
 puts response.ip_address_location.is_in_region.region_name

==== To use your gem from your Ruby on Rails app
In your environment.rb add the following line in the config block:
 config.gem 'developergarden_sdk'

==== Ruby on Rails Example

 class SmsNotification

   USERNAME = "<USER>@t-online.de"
   PASSWORD = "<PASSWORD>"

   # Send SMS to Numbers.
   def send_sms(number, message, originator, environment = 2)

   # Create new SmsService instance
   @sms = SmsService::SmsService.new(USERNAME, PASSWORD)

   # Send SMS to cell phone
   @sms.send_sms(number, message, originator, environment)
   
   end

 end

=== More Examples
In order to see more examples have a look the unit tests included in the gem's source code.
You might also want to have a look at the actual source code and source code comments.

==FAQ
=== Did not understand "MustUnderstand" header(s)
 Handsoap::Fault: Handsoap::Fault { :code => 'soapenv:MustUnderstand', :reason => 'Did not understand "MustUnderstand" header(s):{http://docs.oasis-open.org/wss/2004/01/oasis-200401-wss-wssecurity-secext-1.0.xsd}Security' }

You will receive this error message if a mandatory header element is not present or the remote service was unable to process it.
Most likely this will happen if something is wrong during the authentication process such as missing parameters like username, password.
